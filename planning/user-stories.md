  1. As a user, I want to **quickly** add a recommendation to my list, so that I don't lose track of it.
  2. As a user, I want to manually change the category of an item if it is miscategorized, so that I can keep my list accurate.
  3. As a user, I want to update my profile information, so that I can personalize my app experience. (?) maybe
  4. As a user, I want a fun, easy User Interface with 4 different themes.
